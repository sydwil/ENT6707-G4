Lumping of genera by “Method of Predation”: 3 categories
•	“Passive Trapping”: These are species of plant that use sticky surfaces (leaves mostly) to trap insects = Drosera spp. and Pinguicula spp.
•	“Pitchers”: These are species of plant that use “pitfall” methods to trap insects subsequently drowning them with water reservoirs = Nepenthes spp., Sarracenia spp., and Triphyophyllum spp.
•	“Active Trapping”: These are species of plant that use sticky surfaces in conjunction with hair triggers to actively ensnare insects = Utricularia spp. and Dionaea spp.

**See table below!**
