Cool stuff with hantavirus testing, but the data itself was a little hard to follow.

There are some data sets that basically set out to us what to look for, which, obviously we wouldn’t follow directly, we could explore a related aspect of the data.

  >We could look into specific taxa responses or even specific genera of plants

  >The pollinator-visitation records may be a cool thing to delve deeper into, doesn’t seem to have been as impacted in primary analysis

  >Fire and it’s effects on population dynamics, but we could also look at it from plant species-level

  >Maybe interesting to examine the differences on an order level? If the whole project attempts to encompass restoration, maybe we could examine smaller aspects within the data set

No pointed question

  >Carnivorous plants can be super interesting, and given that they have very different strategies and are often very distantly related it would be interesting to maybe see how their prey differs between lineages

  >In this we aren’t so much at looking over changes in time, but we could compare life history traits, abundance by genera, etc.
